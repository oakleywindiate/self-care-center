# Self Care Center

## Overview

“Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”
 ― Ferris Bueller

We could all take a page from Mr. Bueller's rule book. Self-care is an important aspect of everyone's lives. In this busy world we live in, finding the time to take care of ourselves is a precious commodity.

The Self Care Center's purpose is to allow you to easily find motivational mantras and daily affirmations that are quick and fit into your busy life.

Looking for an affirmation to start your day? Simply click the `affirmation` button and choose `Receive Message` to see your affirmation. Are you busy and working through lunch? Take some time to check out our mantras that are here to motivate you and keep you going. Just click `mantra` and then `Receive Message` to see your daily mantra.
